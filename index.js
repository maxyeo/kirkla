Thanks for taking me onto afx 101, for being my sib during summer TL and for initiating all the hangouts (once a semester), for being the funniest and the most creative teammate on Synergy, and for shaping my whole BDC experience. It's crazy how you're so good at just bringing the best out of people, and having a good time. All the Synergy retreats and socials are defining moments of my college career, and let's be honest, all those memories weren't possible without your custom alcoholic beverages and peer pressure tactics. I really appreciate all that you've done for the community and for my experience here at Berkeley. Hope you enjoy your roasts loser :P",
