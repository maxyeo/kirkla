It's crazy how you're so good at just bringing the best out of people, and having a good time. All the Synergy retreats and socials are defining moments of my college career, and let's be honest, all those memories weren't possible without your custom alcoholic beverages and peer pressure tactics.

But after that i wish i had more interactions with you but you were involved with synergy a lot so i understand.

You have the most unique effect on a crowd and your presence alone is enough to turn a team from awkward to energetic, like when you taught Distractions to T6! By just being who you are and making a genuine effort to spend one on one time with the people around you, you consistently shape us into better people. I been watching a lot of the show “The Good Place” recently, and the premise of the show is that every action in you take has a net positive or negative effect on the world, which can be summarized by a final positive or negative score. So thinking like that, by my count, you ought to be somewhere around +99999999 points because everything you say or do is always good intentioned and is for the betterment of the people you care about.
